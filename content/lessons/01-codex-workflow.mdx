# The Codex workflow loop

Codex works best when you give it a tight scope, clear constraints, and a way to verify the change.
Your job is not to write every line of code; your job is to be the product owner and reviewer.

## The loop we will practice

1. **Plan** the change in one or two sentences.
2. **Prompt** Codex with objective, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
3. **Review the diff** like a teammate wrote it.
4. **Run checks** to prove the change works.
5. **Fix and deploy**.

## Why the loop matters

Beginners often trust the output too quickly. The loop keeps you in control and helps you build real engineering habits that transfer to any stack.
