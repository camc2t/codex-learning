# Prompt Builder Mastery

The Prompt Builder turns fuzzy ideas into an actionable request for Codex. Your goal is to be precise about the outcome, constraints, and how to verify.

## How to use it

- Fill each field with concrete details (no vague language).
- Include what "done" looks like and how you'll check it.
- Keep scope tight: only the files and features you need.

## Exercise 1: Add a hero section

**Goal**: Add a hero section to the landing page with a headline, subhead, and CTA button.

Fill in the Prompt Builder using this info, then compare to the gold prompt below.

**Gold prompt**

```
Objective:
Add a hero section to the landing page with a headline, subhead, and CTA button.

Constraints:
Next.js App Router + Tailwind. Keep existing layout and colors. Do not change auth flow.

Files to touch:
app/page.tsx, styles/globals.css (only if needed for hero spacing)

Acceptance criteria:
Hero shows headline, subhead, and CTA button above the fold on desktop and mobile.
No existing sections removed.

Commands to run:
npm run dev
```

## Exercise 2: Add a protected dashboard banner

**Goal**: Show a "You are signed in" banner only on `/dashboard` when a session exists.

**Gold prompt**

```
Objective:
Show a "You are signed in" banner at the top of /dashboard when a session exists.

Constraints:
Use getServerSession; no client-side session hooks. Keep styling minimal.

Files to touch:
app/dashboard/page.tsx

Acceptance criteria:
Banner appears only for signed-in users and does not appear for signed-out users.

Commands to run:
npm run dev
```

## Exercise 3: Add an exercise hint

**Goal**: Add an extra hint to the "Prompt basics exercise".

**Gold prompt**

```
Objective:
Add one extra hint to the Prompt basics exercise.

Constraints:
Keep hint short and actionable. Do not change expected output.

Files to touch:
content/exercises/02-prompt-basics.json

Acceptance criteria:
The exercise renders with the new hint added at the end of the list.

Commands to run:
npm run dev
```

## Why these prompts work

- Clear objective with a single outcome.
- Constraints prevent scope creep.
- Files to touch prevent surprise edits.
- Acceptance criteria create an objective check.
- Commands to run enforce verification.
