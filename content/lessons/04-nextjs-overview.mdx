# Next.js App Router basics

Next.js uses the **App Router** to compose layouts, server components, and route handlers.

## Key ideas

- The `app/` folder defines routes and layouts.
- Server components run on the server by default.
- Client components opt-in with `"use client"` at the top.
- Route handlers live in `app/api/.../route.ts`.

## Why this matters

You will build a full-stack CRUD app. You need to know where to place server logic and how to ship UI quickly.
