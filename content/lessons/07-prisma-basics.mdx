# Prisma + Postgres

Prisma is a type-safe ORM. You define your data model in `schema.prisma`, then generate a client and run migrations.

## You will do

- Create models for listings and bookings.
- Run migrations and use Prisma Client in API routes.
- Seed data for development.

## Remember

- Update the schema before you code.
- Always run migrations after schema changes.
- Keep data flows explicit (inputs, outputs, errors).
